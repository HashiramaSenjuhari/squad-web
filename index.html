        <H1>Fun Activity</H1>
        <p>One of our squad's specialties is selecting enjoyable activities that truly embody the essence of 'Fun.' Our favorite activity is playing cricket inside our classroom. Engaging in such fun activities not only enhances our physical and mental well-being but also contributes to the development of good sportsmanship skills.
